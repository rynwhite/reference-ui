# Reference Core

This is the core template for a design system.

## Package layout

| What | Where |
|------|--------|
| **Lit Button** | `src/components/Button.ts` – exported as `RefButton` from the main entry |
| **styles.css** | `styled-system/styles.css` – generated by Panda (run `pnpm run gen` or `pnpm dev` in this package); not committed (gitignored) |

## Features
- Panda CSS styled system
- Panda CSS token configuration
- Lit Web component
- outputs to multiple targets


## Compiler integration

- The compiler will effectively house this core within itself and have functions which allow  users to
extend our reference-core.
for demo purposes, we only wish to extend tokens for now.



The Reference System is the core template and semantic foundation of the design system.

It defines the structure, behaviour, and styling model of Reference components.

Responsibilities

Defines the complete Panda CSS styled system

Declares token schema and defaults

Implements core components (Lit-based)

Establishes layout, spacing, and styling semantics

Exposes a closed, parameterisable program to the compiler

Inputs

Design tokens

Compile-time configuration values

Outputs

None directly — all outputs are produced via the compiler

Key invariants

No knowledge of consumers

No filesystem logic

No runtime configuration

No conditional behaviour based on environment

What it is not

❌ A library users import

❌ A configurable framework

❌ A runtime package

❌ A CLI tool

Mental model

The Reference System defines what a design system is.
It does not care who uses it or how.

How the pieces fit together
reference-system
     ↓
reference-compiler
     ↓
@reference-ui/cli
     ↓
node_modules/@reference/*   (generated output)


System defines meaning

Compiler produces artifacts

CLI controls execution and placement

Generated output is disposable build product

Guiding principle (shared across all modules)

Semantics are compile-time.
Values are inputs.
Files are outputs.
Everything is reproducible.

That’s the contract.
